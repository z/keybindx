This is an initial import of an application I had to abandon but still believe has a lot of potential.  I don't have much time to work on it these days myself, so I'm sharing it in it the current state for friends of the project xonotic (www.xonotic.org) to build upon / combine with other projects.  It uses a markup language I've defined as Keyboard Markup Language, KBML which is an abstraction of various keyboard layouts (currently just one).  This application reads and (will write) to KBML files using a PHP/XHTML/AJAX/CSS application.  I apologize in advance for any stupid hacks I used, confusing/lack of comments, sloppy code or whatever has you in a twist.  What I knew then is not what I know now and you can always help by contributing.

Just click login to login, I removed the database stuff for simplicity.

All code I've written and checked in here is released under the GPL unless otherwise noted, in which case I apologize for my neglegence as it is my intent to license all content in this project under the GPL.

It is my hope that the future of this application will help people communicate information about their keybinds to others visually and socially.
